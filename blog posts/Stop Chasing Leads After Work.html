                    <h2>The 6 PM Scramble</h2>
                    <p>It’s a familiar scene for contractors everywhere. The sun is setting, your back aches from a long day on the job site, and you’ve finally kicked off your work boots. But the day isn’t over. Now comes the second shift: the 6 PM scramble. You pull out your phone and start returning calls from a list of unfamiliar numbers—most of which you know are just salespeople pitching software or lenders offering "capital"—hoping the one real lead on the list is still warm and hasn’t already called three of your competitors. It’s a frustrating, inefficient cycle that eats into your personal time and costs you business.</p>
                    <p>But what if you could end that cycle for good? What if potential jobs were captured, qualified, and even booked before you ever got home?</p>

                    <h2>1. Use an AI Agent as Your 24/7 Receptionist</h2>
                    <p>Imagine a receptionist who never sleeps, never takes a break, and instantly fields every single inquiry from your website. That’s what an AI agent does for your business. The moment a homeowner fills out your contact form, the AI springs into action.</p>
                    <p>It can ask basic but crucial qualifying questions like, “Are you looking to remodel a kitchen or a bathroom?” or “What’s your ideal timeline for the job?” This simple step filters out tire-kickers and ensures that by the time you see the lead, you already know they’re serious and what they’re looking for.</p>

                    <h2>2. Automate Your Estimate Booking</h2>
                    <p>Once the AI agent has qualified a lead, it takes the next logical step: it books the estimate for you. The system automatically syncs with your work calendar and offers the potential client a few available time slots. They can pick what works best for them and get on your schedule themselves, right then and there.</p>
                    <p>No more phone tag. No more back-and-forth that delays getting a bid out the door. The entire process is handled for you, so your calendar starts filling up with qualified appointments without you lifting a finger.</p>

                    <h2>3. Never Let a Good Lead Go Cold with Instant Follow-Up</h2>
                    <p>In this business, speed is everything. The first contractor to respond often gets the job. An automated system ensures you are always first. The moment a client fills out your web form, the system can send an immediate, personalized text message.</p>
                    <p>Something as simple as, “Hey [Name], Kevin from [Your Company] here. Got your request for an estimate. I'll take a look and get back to you shortly,” makes a huge difference. It reassures the client they’ve been heard, keeps your company top-of-mind, and stops them from immediately calling the next guy on their list.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion: Reclaim Your Evenings</h2>
                    <p>By implementing these three automated steps, you transform your lead management process. Your AI agent acts as a 24/7 receptionist, your calendar books its own estimates, and instant follow-ups ensure you never miss an opportunity.</p>
                    <p>The result is winning more bids, a more steady flow of work, and—most importantly—the freedom to enjoy your evenings again. The 6 PM scramble becomes a thing of the past.</p>
